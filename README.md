## Design
I took an inspiration from the OpenAI website and made it simpler and easier to create. My site has many elements close to the original website like buttons, links, color palette, input boxes, etc.

## Procedure
It took me about 2 hours to plan and build it. I haven't used any professional developer tools or extensions during the process. I just used the [Geany](https://geany.org) text editor and started coding. The images are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). That's it.

## Tools
- Geany
- Ubuntu
